# Ping

Ping helps you determine the closest region for all your friends to connect on a game server.

## Developing locally

Clone the project and `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`) in the directory. Start a development server with:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `build` directory containing the app. As the server uses [adapter-node](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-node), you can run the app with:

```bash
node socket-server
```

`socket-server/index.js` uses the `handler.js` generated by the build whiuch is suitable for the Express server we are running our server on.

> To deploy, build the app to generate the `handler.js` and simply use the `Dockerfile`` for containerized deployment.
